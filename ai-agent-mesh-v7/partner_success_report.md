## Challenges & Mitigation

### Challenge 1: Certification Bottleneck

**Issue:** Architect certification has 17% failure rate (vs. 13% target)

**Root Cause:** Advanced policy design module too technical, insufficient hands-on labs

**Mitigation:**
- [ ] Redesign Module 10 (Advanced Policy Design) with more interactive labs
- [ ] Add office hours with Mesh OS architects (2x/week)
- [ ] Create "Architect Bootcamp" (3-day intensive)

**Target:** Reduce failure rate to <10% by Q1 2026

---

### Challenge 2: Regional Coverage Gaps

**Issue:** Limited partner coverage in APAC and EMEA (80% of partners in North America)

**Root Cause:** Partner recruitment focused on US/Canada initially

**Mitigation:**
- [ ] Recruit 5 APAC partners (Q1 2026)
- [ ] Recruit 5 EMEA partners (Q1 2026)
- [ ] Localize training content (Japanese, German, French)

**Target:** 40% of partners outside North America by end of 2026

---

### Challenge 3: Small Deal Sizes (Silver/Registered Tiers)

**Issue:** Silver/Registered partners have avg deal size of $25K (vs. $125K for Platinum)

**Root Cause:** Limited technical depth, targeting SMB customers

**Mitigation:**
- [ ] Create "Enterprise Deal Playbook" for mid-tier partners
- [ ] Offer co-selling support (Mesh OS AE joins partner calls)
- [ ] Incentivize enterprise deals (25% bonus commission for deals >$75K)

**Target:** Increase avg deal size to $40K by Q2 2026
