# ===== ROI CALCULATOR =====

roi_calculator:
  assumptions:
    avg_incident_cost: 10000
    avg_downtime_cost_per_hour: 50000
    avg_compliance_violation_cost: 100000
    agents_per_incident_prevented: 10
    
  formula: |
    ROI = (Risk Avoided - Platform Cost) / Platform Cost × 100
    
    Where:
      Risk Avoided = (Agents / 10) × Incident Cost × Prevention Rate
      Prevention Rate = Trust Score / 100
      Platform Cost = Monthly Price × 12

# ===== PRICING PHILOSOPHY =====

pricing_notes: |
  UADSI pricing is designed around value delivery:
  
  1. **Trust Score = Risk Avoided**: Every percentage point of trust
     score improvement directly translates to prevented incidents.
  
  2. **ROI-First**: Typical customers see 10-15× ROI within first year.
  
  3. **Transparent & Predictable**: No hidden fees, clear overage charges.
  
  4. **Scale-Friendly**: Volume discounts and flexible enterprise contracts.
  
  5. **Partner-Enabling**: OEM licensing enables platform integration.

competitive_positioning:
  vs_monitoring_tools: "UADSI quantifies trust and ROI, not just uptime"
  vs_observability: "UADSI predicts incidents before they happen"
  vs_manual_audit: "UADSI provides continuous, automated compliance"
  
price_anchors:
  cost_of_single_incident: 10000
  cost_of_major_outage: 500000
  cost_of_compliance_violation: 100000
  monthly_cost_of_uadsi_pro: 499
  
  value_proposition: "Prevent ONE incident → Pay for UADSI for 20 months"
