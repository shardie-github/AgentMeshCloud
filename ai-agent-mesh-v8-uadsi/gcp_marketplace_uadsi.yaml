  description_long: |
    **Make Your AI Operations Trustworthy, Measurable, and Profitable**
    
    UADSI transforms AI operations from a black box into a transparent, quantified system. 
    Perfect for enterprises running AI agents on Google Cloud.
    
    ## What UADSI Does
    
    ### 🎯 Trust Score (TS)
    Industry-first metric that quantifies agent trustworthiness (0-100%)
    
    **Formula:** (Reliability × 35%) + (Compliance × 30%) + (Performance × 20%) + (Security × 15%)
    
    - **Reliability**: Uptime, execution success, consistency
    - **Compliance**: Policy adherence, audit passes
    - **Performance**: Latency, throughput, resource efficiency
    - **Security**: Vulnerability tracking, incident rates
    
    **Result**: Executives can finally answer "Can I trust my AI agents?"
    
    ### 💰 Risk Avoided (RA$)
    Quantify the monetary value of incidents prevented
    
    - Predictive ML models detect failures before they occur (85% accuracy)
    - Real-time anomaly detection
    - Automated remediation
    - Typical customers avoid $1M+ per 100 agents annually
    
    **Result**: CFOs can justify AI investments with measurable ROI
    
    ### 🔄 Synchronization Intelligence
    Eliminate agent mesh drift — the #1 cause of AI failures
    
    - Real-time temporal alignment monitoring
    - Drift detection (5ms - 5min windows)
    - Automated sync remediation
    - Context consistency validation
    
    **Result**: Engineers maintain 98%+ sync freshness
