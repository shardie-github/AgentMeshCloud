## 2. Trade Secrets

### 2.1 Proprietary Algorithms

**Trade Secret #1: Trust Score Weight Optimization**
**Description:** ML model that adaptively tunes Trust Score weights (w₁-w₅) based on:
- Industry vertical (healthcare, finance, retail, etc.)
- Agent risk profile (critical, high, medium, low)
- Historical incident patterns (customer-specific)

**Protection Method:**
- Source code access restricted (5 engineers, NDA + non-compete)
- Compiled binaries only (no source in production)
- Obfuscation applied to algorithm logic

**Commercial Value:** Core differentiator vs. competitors (static scoring models)

**Estimated Lifespan:** 5-7 years (until ML techniques become commoditized)

---

**Trade Secret #2: Operational Resonance Consensus Protocol**
**Description:** Proprietary algorithm for multi-agent conflict resolution:
- Trust-weighted voting (higher TS = higher vote weight)
- Latency-optimized (< 1 sec resolution for 100+ conflicting agents)
- Game theory-inspired (Nash equilibrium for stable outcomes)

**Protection Method:**
- Patent application filed (see Patent #1), but implementation details remain secret
- Telemetry encrypted (competitors can't reverse-engineer from network traffic)

**Commercial Value:** Enables real-time synchronization at scale (competitors struggle with latency)

---

**Trade Secret #3: Predictive Drift Detection Model**
**Description:** ML model (LSTM + attention mechanism) that forecasts agent policy drift 7 days in advance.
- Training data: 4,200+ agents, 18 months of telemetry
- Accuracy: 91% (early results)
- False positive rate: 6%

**Protection Method:**
- Model weights never exposed (inference-only API)
- Training data proprietary (ORCA telemetry)

**Commercial Value:** Proactive governance (competitors react, ORCA predicts)

---

### 2.2 Proprietary Datasets

**Dataset #1: ORCA Benchmark Index**
**Description:** Anonymized performance data from 47 enterprises, 4,200+ agents:
- Trust Scores (historical trends)
- Incident patterns (root causes, resolutions)
- ROI models (risk avoided, cost saved)

**Protection Method:**
- Contractual (customers consent to anonymized data usage)
- Aggregated public release (individual data never disclosed)
- Raw data access restricted (data science team only)

**Commercial Value:**
- Benchmark API licensing ($50K-$200K annually per analyst firm)
- Market positioning (ORCA = "industry standard")

**Estimated Value:** $5M-$10M (recurring revenue from data licensing)

---

**Dataset #2: Agent Failure Modes Catalog**
**Description:** Taxonomy of 340+ agent failure modes with:
- Root causes (policy drift, data inconsistencies, conflicts, etc.)
- Resolution playbooks (automated remediation steps)
- Success rates (% resolved via self-healing)

**Protection Method:**
- Internal-only (not published)
- Embedded in ORCA self-healing engine

**Commercial Value:** Powers 89% self-healing success rate (competitors at 12%)

---

### 2.3 Trade Secret Management

**Policies:**
1. **Access Control:** "Need-to-know" basis (documented justification required)
2. **NDAs:** All employees, contractors, partners sign NDAs (enforceable via litigation)
3. **Non-Compete:** Key engineers (Trust Engine, Resonance Engine) have 2-year non-competes
4. **Audit Trail:** All access to trade secret systems logged (immutable, reviewed quarterly)

**Legal Protections:**
- Defend the Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) – Federal criminal penalties for theft
- State trade secret laws (California UTSA, New York)

**Incident Response:**
- Quarterly security audits (external penetration testing)
- Employee exit interviews (reminder of trade secret obligations)
- Litigation readiness (retain IP litigation counsel: Cooley LLP)

---

## 3. Open Standards Strategy

### 3.1 ORCA Protocol (Open Specification)

**Rationale:** "Embrace, extend, standardize"
- **Embrace:** Make ORCA interoperable (attract ecosystem partners)
- **Extend:** ORCA Commercial adds proprietary enhancements (Trust Score ML, Resonance Engine)
- **Standardize:** Position ORCA Protocol as industry standard (ISO/NIST adoption)

**Open Components:**
- Trust Score calculation methodology (formula, weights)
- Policy definition language (YAML-based)
- Agent instrumentation protocol (telemetry format)

**Proprietary Components (NOT Open):**
- Trust Score weight optimization (ML model)
- Operational Resonance Engine (consensus algorithm)
- Predictive drift detection (ML model)

**Strategic Benefit:**
- **Network Effects:** More ORCA-compatible agents → higher value
- **Category Leadership:** "ORCA Standard" = industry reference
- **Defensive Moat:** Open standard raises switching costs (lock-in via compatibility)

---

### 3.2 Standards Body Engagement

**Target Organizations:**
1. **NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)**
   - Objective: ORCA Protocol cited in NIST AI RMF guidance
   - Status: Outreach in progress (meeting scheduled Q1 2026)

   - Objective: ORCA Protocol as reference for ISO 42001 implementation
   - Status: Observer status granted; formal proposal planned Q2 2026

3. **IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)**
   - Objective: IEEE standard for agent governance (based on ORCA Protocol)
   - Status: Exploratory discussions

**Timeline:** 3-5 years to formal standard adoption (typical for new categories)

**Benefit:** Standards adoption = category validation = ORCA as de facto leader
