## 1. Methodology

### 1.1 Data Collection

**Sample:**
- **Customers:** 47 enterprises
- **Agents:** 4,200+ monitored continuously
- **Industries:** Financial services (12), healthcare (8), retail & e-commerce (14), manufacturing (9), public sector (4)
- **Period:** 90 days (July 1 - September 30, 2025)

**Data Sources:**
1. **ORCA Platform Telemetry** – Real-time agent metrics (Trust Score, MTTR, incidents)
2. **Customer Surveys** – Audit prep time, ROI validation (n=47, 100% response rate)
3. **Third-Party Audits** – Compliance outcomes (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA)
4. **Market Benchmarks** – Gartner AIOps survey (n=340), IDC AI Governance study (n=280)

### 1.2 Trust Score Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Trust Score = (0.30 × Policy Alignment) + (0.25 × Workflow Conformance) +
              (0.20 × Anomaly Accuracy) + (0.15 × SLA Adherence) +
              (0.10 × Audit Readiness)
```

**Weights validated through:**
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on 4,200 agents
- Customer priority surveys (n=47)
- Regulatory importance mapping (SOC 2, ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF)

### 1.3 Market Comparison

**Market Average Sources:**
- **Gartner AIOps Survey (2025):** 340 enterprises, self-reported governance maturity
- **IDC AI Governance Study (2025):** 280 enterprises, audit preparation times
