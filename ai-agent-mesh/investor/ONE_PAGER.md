# AI-Agent Mesh: One-Pager

## The Governance Layer for Autonomous AI

---

### 🎯 The Problem

**85% of enterprises cite governance and compliance as their #1 barrier to deploying AI agents at scale.**

- AI agents proliferating (50+ per enterprise by 2027)
- No unified governance layer (DIY = months of custom dev)
- Regulatory pressure mounting (EU AI Act, GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2)
- Trust deficit: 78% of CISOs concerned about AI security

### 💡 The Solution

**AI-Agent Mesh is the first enterprise-grade governance and orchestration platform for autonomous AI agents.**

We provide the missing trust layer that enables organizations to deploy AI agents confidently and compliantly — **10x faster** than building in-house.
