# Product Strategy & Value Drivers

## 1. Target Buying Archetypes
- CIO: portfolio rationalization, platform standardization, cost control, vendor strategy.
- CISO: zero-trust enforcement, data loss prevention, unified audit evidence.
- AI Ops Lead: reliability, routing, performance, drift detection, evals automation.
- Compliance Officer: GDPR/SOC 2 readiness, retention, lineage, attestations.

## 2. Pain → Risk → Mesh Resolution
| Pain | Risk | Mesh Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Shadow AI and agent sprawl | Data leakage, noncompliance | Agent Discovery + MCP Registry (canonical inventory) |
| Inconsistent prompts/styles | Brand and safety drift | Prompt Normalization Layer + org templates |
| Ad-hoc model usage | Cost spikes, policy bypass | Policy Enforcer (RBAC, model allowlists, geo controls) |
| No unified telemetry | Blind spots, slow incidents | Observability Hub (logs/metrics/traces) + drift monitors |
| Duplicated inference | Runaway spend, latency | Context Federation Bus + shared caches |
| Weak audit trail | Failing audits | Data Governance Trail (immutable ledger) |

## 3. Measurable Outcomes (Targets)
- Compute cost reduction: target 10–25% via de-duplication, routing, caching.
- Policy adherence: target ≥95% compliant sessions measured via policy engine decisions.
- Latency improvement: target 10–20% via federation and caching of common context.
- Audit readiness: 100% of agent sessions with immutable lineage and evidence.
- Coverage: ≥80% of enterprise agents onboarded in first 90 days.

## 4. Strategic Narrative
Unify fragmented AI agents into a secure, observable mesh. Govern once, enforce everywhere. Standardize prompts and context, federate knowledge, and route to the best model for the job—while capturing end-to-end telemetry and audit evidence.

## 5. Value Drivers
- Operational efficiency: reduce duplicative calls; rationalize models and agents.
- Governance: single audit trail across all agents and sessions.
- Security: zero-trust RBAC, DLP redaction, model allowlists.
- Sustainability: carbon telemetry and efficiency-by-design.
- Resilience: observability, evals, fallback routing.
